# Animation-of-Algorithms-API
This is an API that enables novice programmers to implement algorithms and then add just a few non-invasive lines of code to their program to animate this algorithm in the way they desire. This works with sorting, string matching and binary tree algorithms.

Within this package there is a file called AnimationOfAlgorithms.jar that is ready to be imported into a project.
Code examples have been included to help the user learn the library quickly. There are various examples of 
the different sets of algorithms. The examples include buggy, correct and unstable algorithms.

The project code is contained in the PausePlay-API-master file. The compiler that is needed to run this is the ajc compiler (needed to weave aspects from aspect-oriented programming) - this will need to be downloaded seperately and used instead of the usual JDK in order to modify, run or recompile the codebase.

Please personal message me with any enquiries.
